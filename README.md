- Used my own image (cat + chair)
- Looked up a few things on MDN and W3C while building
- **Added a Reset button to return the background to white and text to black**  
  _(done with JavaScript without refreshing the page for better UX and styled in CSS)_
- Used `document.body.style` to reset the state directly  
  (avoided `location.reload()` to prevent unnecessary refresh and keep performance smooth)

I validated HTML using [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).  
No errors or warnings were found.

Placed media queries for small screen (light blue background)
